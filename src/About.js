        <p>
          I most recently worked as a software engineer at Facebook for 4 years.
          Before that, at Microsoft for a few years. I've worked on a variety of
          consumer products.
        </p>

        <p>A few notable projects I've done outside of work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One thing</li>
          <li>Second thing</li>
          <li>Third thing</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
